sorry for the awful readme, will elaborate .· ´𝓈𝑜𝑜𝓃☆´¨) ¸.·*¨

dots are managed with dotfiles, default target is the home folder
if this is extracted into the home folder no problems, else you have to specify with 

stow -t "$HOME"


pro tip
dont fuck your whole config folder by testing with -nv flags e.g.

stow -nv -t "$HOME"

after you checked that it does what you want you can remove the -n flag

also I installed this gtk theme
